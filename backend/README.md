# 💰 My Personal Finance Manager

Welcome to **My Personal Finance Manager**! 🎉 This is a personal project I'm building to develop my skills in web development, financial data management, and app design. The idea is simple: I want to manage my income, expenses, and finances in one place. Instead of relying on Google Sheets, this app will offer a more practical and efficient way to track my finances. Right now, the app is still in development, but here’s what it will offer when it’s complete.

## 🌟 Planned Features:
- **💼 Income & Expense Tracking**: Easily log your income and expenses, categorize them, and track them over time.
- **📊 Financial Reports**: Visualize your financial situation with reports and insights based on your data.
- **📅 Financial Planning**: Plan future expenses and income, and set reminders for upcoming payments.
- **📈 Investment Management**: Track your investments, see how they grow, and manage them all in one place.
- **💳 Debt Tracking**: Keep track of all your debts, including interest rates, due dates, and creditors.
- **💰 Bank Account Overview**: Manage multiple bank accounts with encrypted balances and transaction histories.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack:
- **Backend**: Django Rest Framework (DRF) powers the backend, managing all data and business logic.
- **Frontend**: React will be used to provide an interactive, user-friendly interface (future implementation).
- **Security**: JWT for authentication to ensure data security and protect user information.

## 🚀 Why Am I Building This?
I’m creating this app to learn more about web development while solving a personal problem. Keeping track of finances can be tricky, so why not build my own tool for it? This is an ongoing project, and I’m learning as I go. It’s more than just code—it’s a practical application that I will use myself.

## 🧑‍💻 Ongoing Development:
As the project evolves, I’ll keep adding new features and improving the existing ones. Currently, the backend is a primary focus, and I’m working on adding more functionality to handle different financial aspects like recurring payments, financial goals, and budget monitoring.

Stay tuned! More to come! 🚀
